# Python Projects

## Collection of Python Programs

This is a small collection of some Python programs I wrote when I was learning Python however it also includes some programs I use often to this day.

### Exponent.py

This was my first Python program where I essentially just made a calculator that only calculates exponents.

### Backwards Guessing Game

This was my first use of the for loop in Python. The program is just a game where instead of the user guessing what number the computer chose, it's the computer guessing what number the user chose while being limited to only having 5 guesses. It prompts the user to input if the computer's guess was "High", "Low", or "Correct" to determine if it should keep guessing or not.

### Savings Calculator

I use this program very often and it's simply a program that calculates how much money in my checking account is left over from my previous check and then tells me the amount to put into savings. It prompts the user to input how much they got paid, and then it takes all of the bills out of that amount and then prompts the user for the total amount in their checking. Then it subtracts that amount from what's left from the current check minus the bills amount, and then determines how much money is left from the previous check which is what should be transferred to savings.

### Quizlet Importer

I use this whenever I need to study something for school. I use [Quizlet](https://www.quizlet.com) and that site allows you to import a text file to quickly add flash cards with questions on one side and answers on the other side. The text file you import must follow a specific pattern for it to be formatted correctly. Similar to a comma-separated file, except the questions are separated from the answer with a "`" and the answer separated from the next question with "``" so this program creates a text file by the name of "qa_data.txt" if that file doesn't already exist. It then prompts you for a question and then an answer, the program takes your inputs and strips any white space before or after the input and then it writes it to the text file with the correct pattern. Once you add all the questions and answers you need to study you can then just import the file to Quizlet and you get a nice formatted page that has everything you wanted to study.
